<!-- USB Ejector -->
## Getting Started

This is a USB ejector GUI, made for Windows, Linux and Mac
it detects the usb devices so you only have to click under the name of the device to eject it.
I have made sure that on mac it does not detect the Macintosh HD and Time Machine Backups

### Prerequisites

You will need the python library PyQt5.
To download it open terminal and type in:
* Terminal
  ```sh
  pip install PyQt5
  ```
  if you have any errors try pip3 instead
  * Terminal
  ```sh
  pip3 install PyQt5
  ```
